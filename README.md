📊 Overview:
Analyzed a healthcare dataset to identify factors contributing to strokes, using Power BI for data modeling and visualization. The goal was to uncover key trends and risk indicators to support early intervention strategies.

🔍 Key Data Insights:
Stroke Rate: 4.87% of the sample population experienced a stroke.
Heart Disease Rate: 5.39%
Hypertension Rate: 9.75%
Average Age: 43.2 years
Sample Size: 5,110 patients

📈 Breakdown by Risk Factors:
1. Age vs Stroke
Stroke likelihood increases with age.
Sharp rise observed in stroke rates above age 60.
Suggests age is a strong independent risk factor.

2. Heart Disease
Patients with heart disease show higher stroke incidence.
Visualization confirms direct correlation between age, heart disease, and stroke risk.

3. Hypertension
Stroke rates are higher in those with hypertension.
Combined effect with age makes this group particularly high risk.

4. Glucose Level
Elevated average glucose levels noted among stroke patients.
Indicates possible link to diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

5. BMI
Higher BMI seen in stroke cases, but less strong than age or heart conditions.
Could be a secondary contributing factor.

💡 Key Takeaways & Suggestions:
Age, heart disease, and hypertension are the top indicators for stroke risk.
Preventive care for patients above 60 with heart or blood pressure issues should be prioritized.
Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise) can help reduce BMI and glucose-related risks.
Data-Driven Alert System: Implement alert systems in healthcare dashboards to flag high-risk individuals using these indicators.

Data Sources (Likely or Inferred):
1.Public Healthcare Datasets
The dataset resembles open-source datasets from platforms like:
Kaggle
UCI Machine Learning Repository
These datasets are often used for health risk prediction models and include attributes like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose level, and stroke occurrence.

2.Simulated Clinical Data
The structure and naming conventions (e.g., hypertension, avg_glucose_level, stroke) suggest the data may have been synthetically generated for academic or training purposes, not from real patient records.

3.Manually Curated for Case Study
The dataset used in healthcare_dataset_stroke_data_v1.xlsx is relatively clean and well-labeled, suggesting it may have been refined or manually prepared to support the dashboard analysis in the provided PDF.

Tools Used:
